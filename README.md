# Monet
The repo is made for the Kaggle competition "Iâ€™m Something of a Painter Myself" available here:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/gan-getting-started/data

Here, we train a GAN on Monet's paintings and use that to transform an input photo to one with the painting style of Monet. 

To use this repo, put images from "monet_jpg" folder in path "data/train" and images from "photo_jpg" in "data/test"
